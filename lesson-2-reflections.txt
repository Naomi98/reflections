What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Whenever a repository is initialised then a hidden file named .git is added
	to its content. This is needed as it marks that it is a repository instead 
	of any other directory. 
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
	Staging area is an intermediate area within Git that contains those files
	which will be included when we make a commit. While working directory and
	repository consists of all the files we have.
